- [x] **Phase 11: WebSocket Connection Manager** - Build and validate outbound WebSocket client with reconnect and heartbeat (completed 2026-03-21)
- [x] **Phase 12: Telegram Removal and Session Migration** - Delete Telegram layer and migrate session identity from channel IDs to project keys (completed 2026-03-21)
- [x] **Phase 13: Dispatch, Instance Management, and Node Lifecycle** - Implement command dispatch, multi-instance management, and end-to-end node wiring (completed 2026-03-21)
- [x] **Phase 14: Protocol and Server Spec Documents** - Write wire protocol spec and server backend spec from working implementation (completed 2026-03-21)

## Phase Details

### Phase 10: Protocol Definitions and Config
**Goal**: All wire message types and config fields exist so every downstream phase can build against a stable contract
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.2)
**Requirements**: PROTO-01, PROTO-02, NODE-01, NODE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `internal/protocol/messages.go` compiles with all inbound and outbound message struct definitions (`Envelope`, `execute`, `kill`, `status_request`, `node_register`, `stream_event`, `instance_started`, `instance_finished`, `instance_error`) and round-trip marshal/unmarshal tests pass
  2. `.env` accepts `SERVER_URL`, `SERVER_TOKEN`, `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS` and the node auto-derives its ID from hardware identifiers without any user-set config field
  3. The registration frame struct includes a running-instance snapshot field, preventing session divergence after reconnect from day one
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Protocol message types and Envelope with round-trip tests
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — Node ID derivation and NodeConfig with env var parsing

### Phase 11: WebSocket Connection Manager
**Goal**: A validated `ConnectionManager` that dials outbound, reconnects automatically, and serializes all writes through a single goroutine — the foundation every other phase depends on
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: XPORT-01, XPORT-02, XPORT-03, XPORT-04, XPORT-05, XPORT-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Node connects to a local mock server over `wss://` and the connection survives a simulated network drop, reconnecting with exponential backoff (500ms-30s with jitter) within observable delay
  2. Heartbeat ping fires every 30 seconds; the connection manager detects a dead server (no pong) within 90 seconds and initiates reconnect without goroutine leak (`go test -race ./...` clean)
  3. Node sends a registration frame after every reconnect, including re-register after recovery from drop
  4. Node sends an explicit disconnect frame on clean shutdown and does not reconnect afterward
  5. A stress test sending concurrent frames from multiple goroutines completes without panic — the single writer goroutine serializes all writes
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — ConnectionManager core: dial, backoff, single writer, dependencies
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — Heartbeat, registration, reconnect recovery, clean shutdown

### Phase 12: Telegram Removal and Session Migration
**Goal**: Zero Telegram imports in the codebase and session persistence keyed by project name rather than channel ID, so the dispatch layer can be built against clean identity types
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02, CLEAN-03, CLEAN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `grep -r "gotgbot\|openai\|telegram" internal/` returns no matches; `go.mod` no longer references `gotgbot/v2` or `openai-go`
  2. TypeScript source files and Bun/npm configuration files are absent from the repository
  3. `internal/session` compiles with `InstanceStore` keyed by `string` (instance UUID); `QueuedMessage` uses `InstanceID string` rather than `ChatID int64`
  4. `sessions.json` on disk uses project-name keys; a migration script converts existing channel-ID-keyed records, logging any unmappable entries rather than silently discarding them
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — Delete Telegram packages, TypeScript files, strip dependencies and config
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — Rekey session persistence from channel IDs to instance/project strings

### Phase 13: Dispatch, Instance Management, and Node Lifecycle
**Goal**: The node receives commands from the server, manages multiple Claude CLI instances simultaneously, streams their output, and shuts down cleanly — the full working node
**Depends on**: Phase 11, Phase 12
**Requirements**: PROTO-03, PROTO-04, PROTO-05, INST-01, INST-02, INST-03, INST-04, INST-05, INST-06, INST-07, NODE-03, NODE-04, NODE-05, NODE-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Node receives a `run` command, ACKs it before execution begins, spawns a Claude CLI subprocess in the correct project working directory, and streams NDJSON output back as `instance_chunk` events — all visible against a mock server
  2. Two simultaneous `run` commands targeting the same project both execute; each carries a distinct UUID in every outgoing frame; `instance_started`, `instance_finished`, and `instance_error` lifecycle events are emitted for each
  3. Node receives a `kill` command with an instance ID and the targeted Claude subprocess terminates; subsequent `instance_error` or `instance_finished` is emitted; other running instances are unaffected
  4. Node responds to a `status` query with the current running instance list
  5. On SIGINT/SIGTERM: active streams drain, remaining Claude subprocesses are killed (verified absent from process list within 10 seconds), disconnect frame is sent, and the process exits cleanly — no zombie processes
  6. All received commands appear in the audit log with source and command type; per-project rate limiting rejects excess `run` commands; structured log entries include `node_id`, `instance_id`, and `project` fields
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Adapt audit, security, and protocol packages for node-oriented dispatch
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md — Build dispatch package: command routing, instance lifecycle, streaming
- [x] 13-03-PLAN.md — Wire main.go with full startup and graceful shutdown

### Phase 14: Protocol and Server Spec Documents
**Goal**: Written specs that give the server team a complete contract for implementing the server side — derived from the working node, not from intention
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: DOCS-01, DOCS-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `docs/protocol-spec.md` exists with the full message type catalog, `Envelope` format, authentication handshake sequence, reconnect behavior, and at least one sequence diagram covering the execute-stream-finish flow
  2. `docs/server-spec.md` exists describing the WebSocket endpoint contract, data models the server must maintain per node and per instance, and the OpenAI Whisper integration point for server-side voice-to-text
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Wire protocol specification (message catalog, Envelope, auth, reconnect, sequence diagrams)
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — Server backend specification (WebSocket endpoint, data models, Whisper integration)

### Phase 15: Project Config and Registration
**Goal**: NodeRegister sends real project list from config so the server knows what projects the node can handle
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: PROTO-01, NODE-02
**Gap Closure:** Closes gaps from v1.2 audit
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `NodeConfig` has a `Projects []string` field populated from environment or config file
  2. `NodeRegister` frame includes the configured project list (not empty `[]`)
  3. Tests verify projects round-trip through registration
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Add PROJECTS env var to NodeConfig and wire through to NodeRegister frame

### Phase 16: Instance Lifecycle Fixes
**Goal**: Instance finish events carry real exit codes and session IDs so the server can track instance outcomes and resume sessions
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: INST-04, INST-07
**Gap Closure:** Closes gaps from v1.2 audit
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `InstanceFinished.ExitCode` reflects the real process exit code extracted from `exec.ExitError`, not hardcoded `0`
  2. `InstanceFinished` includes a `SessionID` field populated from `proc.SessionID()` so the server learns new session IDs
  3. `docs/protocol-spec.md` and `docs/server-spec.md` updated to reflect `session_id` field and real exit code semantics
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md — Real exit code extraction, SessionID on InstanceFinished, and spec doc updates

### Phase 17: Dead Code Removal and Test Fixes
**Goal**: Remove Telegram-era dead code and fix test infrastructure so `go test -race ./...` passes clean
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: CLEAN-02, CLEAN-04
**Gap Closure:** Closes gaps from v1.2 audit
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ChannelRateLimiter` type and its tests are deleted from `security/ratelimit.go`
  2. `internal/session` package is either wired into production code at startup or removed entirely
  3. Dispatch tests use a thread-safe logger — `go test -race ./internal/dispatch/...` passes
  4. `TestValidatePathWindowsTraversal` is platform-aware and passes on macOS
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md — Delete ChannelRateLimiter, IsAuthorized, and internal/session package
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md — Fix dispatch test data race and platform-aware Windows test guard

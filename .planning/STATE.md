# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Control Claude Code remotely from Telegram across multiple projects simultaneously, each in its own channel with its own Claude session.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — core-bot-infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (core-bot-infrastructure) — EXECUTING
Plan: 6 of 8

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 20min
- Total execution time: 40min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 40min | 20min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: —
- Trend: —

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key decisions affecting Phase 1:

- Go over TypeScript (user preference, goroutines match concurrent session model)
- JSON persistence over SQLite (no schema migration, sufficient for use case)
- Per-channel auth over global allowlist (scales with multi-channel model)
- Windows Service deployment target (runs at boot without login)

Phase 1, Plan 3 (security subsystem):

- Reserve()+Cancel() pattern for rate limiter: gives delay duration without consuming token
- IsAuthorized accepts channelID param (unused Phase 1) for Phase 2 forward-compatibility
- filepath.ToSlash normalization on both sides for cross-platform path comparison

Phase 1, Plan 5 (formatting package):

- EscapeMarkdownV2 escapes backslash first (prevents double-escaping)
- ConvertToMarkdownV2 uses NUL-byte placeholders for extracted code blocks
- SplitMessage splits at last double-newline before limit (paragraph boundary preference)
- FormatToolStatus outputs plain text (not HTML) for MarkdownV2 compatibility
- Bullet detection uses only `-` prefix to avoid conflict with bold `**` pattern

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Six infrastructure pitfalls must be addressed before any feature work (process tree kill, concurrent map mutex, goroutine leak from pipe cleanup, JSON atomic writes, context limit detection, PATH blindness). Research SUMMARY.md has full details.
- Phase 1 BLOCKER: Go toolchain not installed on this machine. All go test verifications cannot run until Go is installed and `go mod tidy` is run to generate go.sum.
- Phase 1 NOTE: Plans 01-01 and 01-02 have not been executed. go.mod was created by plan 01-03 as a deviation, but config and audit packages are missing. These should be executed before or alongside 01-04.
- Phase 2: Telegram rate limit flood risk scales with simultaneous streaming sessions — global API rate limiter required.
- Phase 3: NSSM environment variable configuration for user-installed tools needs hands-on verification on target machine.

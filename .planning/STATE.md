## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key decisions affecting Phase 1:

- Go over TypeScript (user preference, goroutines match concurrent session model)
- JSON persistence over SQLite (no schema migration, sufficient for use case)
- Per-channel auth over global allowlist (scales with multi-channel model)
- Windows Service deployment target (runs at boot without login)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Six infrastructure pitfalls must be addressed before any feature work (process tree kill, concurrent map mutex, goroutine leak from pipe cleanup, JSON atomic writes, context limit detection, PATH blindness). Research SUMMARY.md has full details.
- Phase 2: Telegram rate limit flood risk scales with simultaneous streaming sessions — global API rate limiter required.
- Phase 3: NSSM environment variable configuration for user-installed tools needs hands-on verification on target machine.

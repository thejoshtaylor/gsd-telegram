# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** Control Claude Code remotely from Telegram across multiple projects simultaneously, each in its own channel with its own Claude session.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — media-handlers-and-windows-service

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (media-handlers-and-windows-service) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 4

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 17min
- Total execution time: 72min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | 72min | 18min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key decisions affecting Phase 1:

- Go over TypeScript (user preference, goroutines match concurrent session model)
- JSON persistence over SQLite (no schema migration, sufficient for use case)
- Per-channel auth over global allowlist (scales with multi-channel model)
- Windows Service deployment target (runs at boot without login)

Phase 1, Plan 1 (config and audit packages):

- Config Load() returns error instead of panicking — cleaner for service restart handling
- FilteredEnv() strips CLAUDECODE= from subprocess env — prevents nested session error (Pitfall 8)
- Audit logger uses json.Encoder.Encode() for atomic JSON line writes under sync.Mutex
- Go 1.26.1 installed via winget on Windows 11 (was missing from PATH)

Phase 1, Plan 2 (Claude CLI subprocess):

- io.ReadCloser fields on Process struct for stdout/stderr (StdoutPipe/StderrPipe returns separate readers)
- Test fixtures use temp files + type/cat (cmd.exe echo corrupts JSON special characters)
- ContextPercent computes (inputTokens + outputTokens) * 100 / contextWindow (no cache tokens)
- ErrContextLimit sentinel from Stream() allows errors.Is discrimination from other errors

Phase 1, Plan 3 (security subsystem):

- Reserve()+Cancel() pattern for rate limiter: gives delay duration without consuming token
- IsAuthorized accepts channelID param (unused Phase 1) for Phase 2 forward-compatibility
- filepath.ToSlash normalization on both sides for cross-platform path comparison

Phase 1, Plan 5 (formatting package):

- EscapeMarkdownV2 escapes backslash first (prevents double-escaping)
- ConvertToMarkdownV2 uses NUL-byte placeholders for extracted code blocks
- SplitMessage splits at last double-newline before limit (paragraph boundary preference)
- FormatToolStatus outputs plain text (not HTML) for MarkdownV2 compatibility
- Bullet detection uses only `-` prefix to avoid conflict with bold `**` pattern
- [Phase 01]: Worker goroutine started by bot layer not GetOrCreate — caller injects claudePath and WorkerConfig for decoupling
- [Phase 01]: ErrContextLimit from Stream() clears sessionID so next message starts fresh Claude session (mirrors TypeScript auto-clear)
- [Phase 01]: QueuedMessage.ErrCh chan error allows async error propagation from Worker to callers
- [Phase 01]: parseCallbackData extracted as pure function so callback routing is fully testable without gotgbot types
- [Phase 01]: buildStatusText extracted as pure function so status format is verifiable in unit tests without Bot dependency
- [Phase 01]: Interface-based AuthChecker/RateLimitChecker in middleware enables unit testing without live Telegram connection
- [Phase 01]: Worker goroutine heuristic (SessionID empty + StartedAt within 1s) distinguishes new vs restored sessions in HandleText
- [Phase 01]: context.Background() for HandleText-spawned workers; bot context threading deferred to Plan 07
- [Phase 01]: context.WithCancel in main() owns root context; bot.Start blocks on ctx.Done(); cancel() before b.Stop() ensures workers drain before shutdown
- [Phase 01]: Smoke test approved: end-to-end flow verified with real Telegram credentials — bot connects, streams Claude responses, and all commands work including session persistence via /resume
- [Phase 01]: Delegated all five command handlers to real bothandlers implementations; registered callbackquery.All for callback routing

Phase 2, Plan 1 (MappingStore + GSD pure functions):

- [Phase 02-01]: MappingStore uses string-keyed JSON (mappingsFile struct) because JSON object keys must be strings — int64 keys serialized via strconv.FormatInt/ParseInt
- [Phase 02-01]: ExtractLetteredOptions requires sequential letters (A→B) not merely 2+ items — prevents false positives from non-list uppercase content
- [Phase 02-01]: BuildPhasePickerKeyboard silently skips "skipped" phases — they are not actionable
- [Phase 02-01]: gsdOpIndex precomputed at package init for O(1) label lookup in ExtractGsdCommands
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02-02]: workerStarted bool field on Session replaces StartedAt heuristic — more reliable single-start guard for Worker goroutine
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02-02]: mapping.Path used as WorkingDir in OnQueryComplete — ties PersistenceManager per-WorkingDir trimming to per-project isolation
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02-02]: HandleResume filters sessions to mapping.Path when hasMapped; falls back to all channel sessions if no mapping (graceful degradation)
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02-03]: callbackWg package-level var tracks callback-spawned workers; bot-level WaitGroup tracks text-path workers (callbacks only enqueue to existing workers)
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02-03]: waitForRateLimit() uses 5s timeout context before each Telegram API call — drops edit on timeout (shutdown safety, not error)
- [Phase 02]: [Phase 02-03]: HandleGsd accepts wg param for API consistency but ignores it — enqueueGsdCommand manages its own goroutine lifecycle for callbacks
- [Phase 02]: No integration issues found — Plans 01-03 compiled and passed all tests cleanly on first run
- [Phase 03-01]: transcribeVoiceURL/downloadFromURL as testable internal helpers — public functions delegate to them; tests inject mock HTTP server URL without live Telegram/OpenAI
- [Phase 03-01]: MediaGroupBuffer.Add uses chatID/userID int64 not *ext.Context — decouples media_group.go from gotgbot, enables straightforward unit testing
- [Phase 03-01]: extractPDF partial extraction — on non-zero exit code with non-empty stdout, return partial output as success (handles encrypted/partial PDFs per Pitfall 4)
- [Phase 03-01]: First non-empty caption wins in MediaGroupBuffer — empty-string captions from items without captions do not block real captions from later items
- [Phase 03-03]: truncateText uses byte-length not rune-length for simplicity (consistent with maxTextChars constant)
- [Phase 03-03]: Document album snippets stored as pre-formatted prompt strings in MediaGroupBuffer paths array (avoids extra data structure)
- [Phase 03-03]: photo_stub.go created to unblock parallel compilation while Plan 03-02 develops photo.go (superseded once photo.go landed)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Six infrastructure pitfalls must be addressed before any feature work (process tree kill, concurrent map mutex, goroutine leak from pipe cleanup, JSON atomic writes, context limit detection, PATH blindness). Research SUMMARY.md has full details.
- Phase 1 NOTE: Go 1.26.1 installed via winget (01-01 session). Plans 01-01, 01-02, 01-03, 01-05 complete. Plans 01-04, 01-06, 01-07, 01-08 pending.
- Phase 2: Telegram rate limit flood risk scales with simultaneous streaming sessions — global API rate limiter required.
- Phase 3: NSSM environment variable configuration for user-installed tools needs hands-on verification on target machine.

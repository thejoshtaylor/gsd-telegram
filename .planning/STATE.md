# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** Control Claude Code remotely from Telegram across multiple projects simultaneously, each in its own channel with its own Claude session.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — polling-stability

## Current Position

Phase: 08 (polling-stability) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 1

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v1.1 research]: Use `RequestOpts.Timeout` nested inside `GetUpdatesOpts` — not `DefaultRequestOpts` on `BaseBotClient` (global override would affect all API calls)
- [v1.1 research]: Use `sender.IsUser()` as the universal gate for non-human senders — covers anonymous admins and linked-channel forwards that `IsChannelPost()` alone misses
- [v1.1 research]: Auth fix must be an additive branch — never restructure the existing user-ID check path
- [Phase 08-polling-stability]: Use RequestOpts.Timeout (15s) inside GetUpdatesOpts to scope HTTP timeout override to polling only, not all API calls

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 9]: After auth fix ships, operators must add their channel's numeric ID to `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` in `.env`. Plan must document this or channels will still fail auth after the code fix.

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0 (v1.1)
- v1.0 reference: 24 plans across 7 phases

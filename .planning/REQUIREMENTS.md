# Requirements: GSD Telegram Bot (Go Rewrite)

**Defined:** 2026-03-20
**Core Value:** Control Claude Code remotely from Telegram across multiple projects simultaneously, each in its own channel with its own Claude session.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for bugfix release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Channel Auth

- [ ] **AUTH-01**: Bot correctly authorizes messages in Telegram channels where sender is the channel itself (non-user sender)
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: Bot filters its own messages reflected back as ChannelPost updates without processing them

### Polling Stability

- [ ] **POLL-01**: Long-polling getUpdates requests do not produce `context deadline exceeded` errors under normal operation

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Channel Auth Hardening

- **AUTH-03**: Auth rejection message is suppressed in public channel timelines (reply-into-channel regression)

### Media

- **MEDIA-06**: Video file transcription
- **MEDIA-07**: Audio file transcription improvements
- **MEDIA-08**: Archive file extraction

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Per-channel membership auth | JSON allowlist sufficient for single-operator bot |
| AllowChannel handler flag | Bot receives channel posts via middleware, not message handlers |
| Anonymous admin auth | Not a reported issue; defer unless surfaced |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| AUTH-01 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| AUTH-02 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| POLL-01 | Phase 8 | Pending |

**Coverage:**
- v1.1 requirements: 3 total
- Mapped to phases: 3
- Unmapped: 0 ✓
